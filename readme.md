# React "Ravens Black Market" E-commerce SPA Project (for Coderhouse's React Course)

This is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://react.dev/).  
It’s a project based on the "Armored Core" franchise, for a React Course that I'm doing in Coderhouse. 
It mimics an e-commerce platform that has routing, UI components, and user interactions using some libraries.
